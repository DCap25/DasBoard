ðŸ§¹ SUPABASE CLEANUP COMMANDS
============================

Copy and paste these SQL commands one by one into your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. PREVIEW what will be deleted (run this first to see what will be removed):

SELECT email, status, created_at 
FROM signup_requests 
WHERE email NOT IN (
  SELECT email FROM auth.users WHERE email IS NOT NULL
)
ORDER BY created_at DESC;


2. DELETE orphaned signup_requests:

DELETE FROM signup_requests 
WHERE email NOT IN (
  SELECT email FROM auth.users WHERE email IS NOT NULL
);


3. VERIFY the cleanup worked:

SELECT COUNT(*) as remaining_requests FROM signup_requests;


4. VIEW remaining requests (should all have corresponding auth users):

SELECT 
  sr.email as signup_email,
  au.email as auth_email,
  sr.status,
  sr.created_at
FROM signup_requests sr
LEFT JOIN auth.users au ON sr.email = au.email
ORDER BY sr.created_at DESC;
