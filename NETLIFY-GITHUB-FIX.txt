NETLIFY GITHUB REPOSITORY FIX
=============================

PROBLEM:
--------
thedasboard.com (d967da04-9e37-4c8e-ab88-4fb29c3276b0) is deploying from:
❌ das-board-marketing repository (broken Next.js)
Instead of:
✅ DasBoard repository (working Vite build)

SOLUTION:
---------
Update Netlify to point to the DasBoard repository instead of das-board-marketing.

STEP 1: Ensure Dashboard is on GitHub
-------------------------------------
From E:\WebProjects\dasboard directory:
1. Run: git remote -v (check current repository)
2. If no repository, create one on GitHub
3. Push dashboard code: git push origin master

STEP 2: Update Netlify Repository Link
--------------------------------------
Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/d967da04-9e37-4c8e-ab88-4fb29c3276b0/settings/deploys

Option A - Link Different Repository:
1. Scroll to "Repository" section
2. Click "Link to a different repository"
3. Choose your DasBoard repository (NOT das-board-marketing)
4. Authorize GitHub access if needed

Option B - Update Build Settings:
1. Scroll to "Build settings"
2. Click "Edit settings"
3. Update these fields:
   ✅ Build command: npm run build
   ✅ Publish directory: dist
   ✅ Branch: master (or main)

STEP 3: Trigger New Deployment
------------------------------
1. Go to "Deploys" tab
2. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
3. Wait for build to complete (2-5 minutes)

STEP 4: Verify Success
---------------------
1. Check deployment logs for success
2. Visit https://thedasboard.com
3. Should now show dashboard login (not 404)

CURRENT REPOSITORY STRUCTURE:
============================
das-board-marketing (broken):
- GitHub: das-board-marketing repository
- Location: E:\WebProjects\das-board-marketing
- Build: Next.js (failing)
- Purpose: Landing page

DasBoard (working):
- GitHub: DasBoard repository  
- Location: E:\WebProjects\dasboard
- Build: Vite (successful)
- Purpose: Main application

WHAT NETLIFY SHOULD BUILD:
=========================
Repository: DasBoard repository
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: dist
Branch: master/main
Result: Working dashboard at thedasboard.com

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
If build still fails:
1. Check build logs in Netlify
2. Ensure package.json has correct build script
3. Verify dist/ folder is created during build
4. Check Node.js version compatibility

If deployment succeeds but 404 persists:
1. Check if dist/index.html exists
2. Verify routing configuration
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check Netlify redirects
