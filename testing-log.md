- ✅ Mock API (http://localhost:3001) connects properly
- ✅ Live Supabase connection can be configured via environment variables
- ✅ ESLint checks pass with no warnings
- ✅ Build completes with no errors

## Additional Testing Performed
- ✅ Created comprehensive testing script (run-comprehensive-tests.ps1)
- ✅ Developed detailed manual testing guide (manual-testing-guide.md)
- ✅ Fixed directory structure issues
- ✅ Added process termination for ports 3001 and 5173 in start-services.ps1
- ✅ Tested all user roles and their access permissions
- ✅ Verified multi-tenant isolation is working properly
- ✅ Tested edge cases including form validation and error handling

## Identified Issues and Fixes

### TypeScript Type Issues
1. Fixed Supabase.ts:
   - Added proper UserProfile interface 
   - Fixed type definitions for Auth responses

2. Fixed ApiService.ts:
   - Updated 'any' types to 'unknown' for better type safety
   - Added proper return types for functions
   - Fixed optional chaining for session access_token

3. Fixed AuthContext.tsx:
   - Removed dependency on external Supabase SDK types
   - Fixed authentication method signatures to match API service
   - Improved error handling with instanceof Error checks

4. Fixed Dashboard.tsx:
   - Resolved unused variables warning
   - Added metrics display section to utilize metrics data
   - Improved component structure

### Build Process Issues
1. ESLint Configuration:
   - Updated to use flat config format for ESLint v9
   - Added global TypeScript declarations for browser objects
   - Configured proper rules for the codebase

2. Environment Configuration:
   - Created PowerShell startup script that handles Windows command limitations
   - Added port checking to prevent conflicts
   - Set up proper Mock API connection

### PowerShell Compatibility
1. Created start-services.ps1 script to start both the API and dashboard application
2. Added port conflict detection to prevent errors
3. Included helpful instructions for testing and using the application

### Directory Structure Issues
1. Fixed nested directory problem (dasboard inside dasboard)
2. Ensured all files are in the correct locations
3. Updated paths in scripts to reference correct locations

## Testing Instructions for Users
1. Run the start-services.ps1 script to start both services:
   ```
   .\start-services.ps1
   ```

2. Access the application at http://localhost:5173/

3. Test authentication with these credentials:
   - Salesperson: testsales@example.com / password
   - Finance Manager: testfinance@example.com / password
   - Sales Manager: testmanager@example.com / password
   - General Manager: testgm@example.com / password
   - Admin: testadmin@example.com / password

4. Verify that each role has access to appropriate features and can only see data for dealership-1.

5. To stop the services:
   ```
   npm run stop
   ```
   Or close the PowerShell windows.

## Conclusion
The application is functioning correctly with the implementations and fixes applied. All core features are working as expected, and the multi-tenant data isolation is properly enforced. The UI is consistent across all views with proper theme support.

The TypeScript errors have been resolved, and the application now builds successfully. The ESLint configuration has been updated to work with the latest version, and the PowerShell compatibility issues have been addressed with a custom startup script. The application is now ready for deployment and further development.
