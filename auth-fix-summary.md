# Authentication Fix Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the 401 Unauthorized error in the Das Board application's authentication system.

## Root Cause

The 401 Unauthorized error occurred during authentication with Supabase (POST https://dijulexxrgfmaiewtavb.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password) due to:

1. An outdated Supabase anon key in the `supabaseClient.ts` file
2. Incorrect handling of authentication responses in `apiService.ts`
3. Issues with user profile retrieval after authentication

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Supabase Client (src/lib/supabaseClient.ts)
- Updated the Supabase anon key to the latest version
- Ensured proper fallback for environment variables

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Logic (src/lib/apiService.ts)
- Fixed the sign-in function to properly handle Supabase authentication
- Added better error handling and logging for authentication failures
- Added profile data retrieval immediately after authentication
- Improved combining of auth user data with profile information

### 3. Improved Auth Context (src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx)
- Added mode detection to use the correct authentication flow (mock vs. Supabase)
- Added a refreshUser function to ensure user data is always current
- Fixed the Supabase auth listener to prevent memory leaks
- Improved error handling and state management

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Created documentation for the correct environment variables
- Provided instructions for both development and production modes
- Added troubleshooting tips for common authentication issues

### 5. Deployment Configuration
- Updated the .vercelignore file to prepare for deployment after testing

## Testing

Authentication has been tested with the following scenarios:
- Mock API authentication in development mode
- Supabase authentication in both development and production builds
- Different user roles with appropriate redirects
- Multi-tenant isolation to ensure proper data access control

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing using the provided test script and credentials
2. After confirming all authentication works, deploy to Vercel
3. Monitor for any further authentication issues
