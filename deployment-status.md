# Deployment Status Log

## April 28, 2025 - Undeployment from Vercel

### Reason for Undeployment
The application was undeployed from Vercel due to persistent authentication issues in the production environment. While the local development environment works correctly with the mock API, the Supabase integration needs additional work for production use.

### Actions Taken
- Removed deployment from Vercel Dashboard
- Verified that the production URL (https://dasboard-app.vercel.app) is no longer accessible
- Updated GitHub repository README with deployment status
- Created this deployment log
- Ensured local development workflow remains intact

### Technical Issues to Resolve
1. Authentication token handling in `src/lib/apiService.ts` needs to be updated to work properly with Supabase authentication
2. Context synchronization between `src/lib/AuthContext.tsx` and `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` needs to be resolved
3. Type definitions in `src/lib/supabase.ts` need to be aligned with actual Supabase schema

### Re-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Fix authentication token management
- [ ] Update Supabase client configuration
- [ ] Test all authentication flows with live Supabase
- [ ] Validate multi-tenant isolation
- [ ] Verify role-based access controls
- [ ] Complete integration tests according to `supabase-test-guide.md`
- [ ] Update environment configuration
- [ ] Create new Vercel deployment

### Local Development Status
Local development remains fully functional:
- Mock API runs on port 3001
- Frontend development server runs on port 5173
- All features work properly in the local environment

### Important Files
- `.env.development` - Contains development environment settings
- `.env.production` - Contains production environment settings (needs updates)
- `src/lib/apiService.ts` - Main API service that needs updates
- `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` - Supabase client configuration
