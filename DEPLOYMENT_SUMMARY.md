- **Marketing**: `thedasboard.com/`
- **Requirements**: Reverse proxy configuration needed

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Netlify

1. Login to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure build settings as specified above
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy!

### 2. Domain Configuration

- Set up custom domain in Netlify
- Configure DNS records
- Enable HTTPS (automatic)

### 3. Testing

- Test authentication flow
