# 🚨 URGENT: Netlify Deployment Fix Required

## Issue Summary

Your Netlify site (ID: `d967da04-9e37-4c8e-ab88-4fb29c3276b0`) has the **Next.js plugin enabled**, but this is a **React Vite application**. This is causing deployment failures.

## ✅ Required Actions (You Need to Do This)

### Step 1: Access Netlify Dashboard

1. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Login to your account
3. Navigate to your site with ID: `d967da04-9e37-4c8e-ab88-4fb29c3276b0`

### Step 2: Disable Next.js Plugin

1. Go to **Site Configuration** → **Build & Deploy** → **Plugins**
2. Find **"Next.js Runtime"** or **"@netlify/plugin-nextjs"**
3. **Disable** or **Remove** this plugin
4. Save the changes

### Step 3: Update Build Settings

1. Go to **Site Configuration** → **Build & Deploy** → **Build Settings**
2. Set the following:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Node version**: `18`

### Step 4: Clear Build Command Override

If there's a build command override showing `npm run build:static`, clear it:

1. In **Build Settings**
2. Look for any overrides in the build command
3. Clear/remove any custom build commands
4. Ensure it uses the default: `npm run build`

## 🔧 After Making These Changes

Once you've completed the above steps in Netlify dashboard, run this command:

```powershell
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist --site=d967da04-9e37-4c8e-ab88-4fb29c3276b0
```

## 📋 Alternative: Manual File Upload

If the CLI deployment still doesn't work, you can:

1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Go to **Deploys** tab
3. Drag and drop the entire `dist` folder to the deploy area
4. Or use **"Deploy manually"** option

## ✅ Success Indicators

Deployment is successful when you see:

- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ No Next.js plugin errors
- ✅ Site deploys and is accessible
- ✅ React routing works properly

## 🔍 Current Status

**Build Ready**: ✅ Production build is ready in `dist/` folder (260KB optimized)
**Config Ready**: ✅ `netlify.toml` and `_redirects` are configured
**Issue**: ❌ Next.js plugin conflict in Netlify site settings

## 📞 If You Need Help

The main issue is that your Netlify site was previously configured for Next.js but this is a React Vite application. The fix is purely in the Netlify dashboard settings - no code changes needed.

After fixing the Netlify settings, the deployment should work perfectly with the current configuration.
