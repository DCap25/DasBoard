# Finance Manager Subscription and Deal Logging Implementation

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Marketing Website (das-board-marketing)

- Updated the SignupForm component to handle Finance Manager Only subscription with $5/month pricing and 30-day free trial
- Implemented diagnostic logging to track signup flow and error handling
- Improved Supabase connection with schema cache skipping for more reliable database operations

### 2. Database Schema Management (dasboard)

- Created supabaseAdmin.ts with functions to:
  - Create unique schemas for each Finance Manager user
  - Set up deals tables with proper schema
  - Configure Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
- Added SQL stored procedures for schema operations in finance_manager_functions.sql:
  - create_schema_with_tables
  - create_deals_table
  - setup_deals_rls_policies

### 3. Finance Manager Dashboard (dasboard)

- Added "Log New Deal" button to the SingleFinanceHomePage component
- Created a DealLog component to display deals from the user's schema
- Enhanced LogNewDealPage to save deals to the user's schema in Supabase
- Added extensive logging throughout to track the flow and diagnose issues

## Schema-Based Multi-Tenancy Implementation

- Each Finance Manager is assigned a unique schema (e.g., finance_mgr_123abc)
- Schema assignment is tracked in the schema_user_mappings table
- All user data is saved to their specific schema, ensuring:
  - Data isolation between users
  - Secure access through RLS policies
  - Efficient data retrieval

## Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Marketing Website (das-board-marketing)

- Test the signup flow for Finance Manager Only subscription
- Verify the signup request is properly saved to the signup_requests table
- Test the trial period (30 days) and subsequent Stripe payment flow

### 2. Admin Dashboard (dasboard)

- Test the schema creation flow when approving a Finance Manager signup
- Verify that RLS policies are correctly applied to the deals tables
- Test user schema mapping and access controls

### 3. Finance Manager Dashboard (dasboard)

- Test the "Log New Deal" button and form submission
- Verify deals are saved to the correct user's schema
- Test the DealLog component to ensure it displays only the user's deals
- Verify that metrics are calculated correctly based on the user's deals

### 4. Environment Configuration

- Ensure Stripe keys are properly configured in both the marketing site and dashboard
- Verify Supabase connection settings and service role key access

## Pre-Live Status

- The site is currently accessible only via the development URLs:
  - Marketing site: http://localhost:3000
  - Dashboard: http://localhost:5173
- DNS settings have not been updated to point to thedasboard.com
- Additional testing is needed before going live, with a focus on:
  - User authentication flows
  - Payment processing with Stripe
  - Schema isolation and data security
  - General UX and responsiveness
