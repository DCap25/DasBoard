OVERRIDE GITHUB DEPLOYMENT ON THEDASBOARD.COM
==========================================

PROBLEM: 
thedasboard.com (d967da04-9e37-4c8e-ab88-4fb29c3276b0) is still using GitHub deployment 
with broken Next.js build, causing 404 errors.

SOLUTION: 
Override with manual deployment of dashboard files.

STEP-BY-STEP FIX:
================

STEP 1: Go to Netlify Site
--------------------------
URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/d967da04-9e37-4c8e-ab88-4fb29c3276b0

STEP 2: Disable GitHub Deployment (CRITICAL)
--------------------------------------------
1. Click "Site settings" (top menu)
2. Go to "Build & deploy" (left sidebar)
3. Scroll to "Continuous deployment"
4. Click "Edit settings" next to "Build settings"
5. CLEAR the "Build command" field (remove "npm run build")
6. CLEAR the "Publish directory" field (remove "out")
7. Click "Save"

OR disconnect GitHub entirely:
1. In "Build & deploy" section
2. Find "Repository" section
3. Click "Disconnect" or "Unlink repository"

STEP 3: Manual Upload Dashboard
------------------------------
1. Go to "Deploys" tab
2. Look for manual deployment options:
   - "Deploy manually" button
   - "Drag and drop" area
   - "Browse to choose folder" link

3. Upload from: E:\WebProjects\dasboard\dist\
   - Upload ALL files in the dist folder
   - Including index.html and assets/ folder

STEP 4: Verify Success
---------------------
1. Wait for deployment to complete (1-2 minutes)
2. Go to https://thedasboard.com
3. Should now show dashboard login page (NOT 404)

ALTERNATIVE IF MANUAL DEPLOY NOT VISIBLE:
=========================================
1. Create new deployment by visiting: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag your dist folder there
3. After upload completes:
   - Go to Site Settings
   - Domain management
   - Change primary domain to thedasboard.com
   - Remove domain from old site (d967da04...)

VERIFICATION:
============
✅ thedasboard.com shows dashboard login
✅ No more GitHub builds happening
✅ Manual deployment successful in Netlify dashboard

KEY POINT: You MUST disable the GitHub build first, or it will keep overriding your manual uploads!
