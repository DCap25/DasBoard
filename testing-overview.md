- Added test user accounts in `testAccounts.ts` for authentication testing
- Implemented theme testing in `themeTester.ts` to verify UI consistency
- Created build testing in `buildTest.ts` to verify the build process

### 3. ESLint Configuration
- Added `.eslintrc.js` with appropriate settings for React and TypeScript
- Suppressed common warnings during development
- Added a lint script in package.json

### 4. UI Consistency
- Ensured consistent dark/light mode toggle across the application

## Running Tests

1. Start the Sales API:
   ```
   cd sales-api-new
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Run the application tests:
   ```
   cd dasboard
   npm run test
   ```

3. Test the build process:
   ```
   cd dasboard
   npm run test:build
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   cd dasboard
   npm run dev
   ```

The testing framework provides detailed reporting on each test case and will exit with an appropriate error code if any tests fail.
