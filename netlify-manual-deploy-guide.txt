NETLIFY MANUAL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
================================

If you can't find "Deploy manually" button, try these locations:

METHOD 1: Direct Site URL
------------------------
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/d967da04-9e37-4c8e-ab88-4fb29c3276b0
2. This takes you directly to your site dashboard

METHOD 2: From Site Overview
---------------------------
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Find your site (thedasboard.com)
3. Click on the site name

LOOK FOR THESE OPTIONS:
=====================
- "Deploys" tab (main deployment area)
- "Deploy site" button (usually green/blue)
- "Drag and drop your site output folder here" (big dashed box)
- "Browse to choose folder" link
- "Manual deploy" section
- "Upload folder" option

IF STILL NOT FOUND:
==================
1. Look for a "+" button or "New deploy" button
2. Check if there's a "Site settings" → "Build & deploy" section
3. Look for "Deploy settings" → "Manual deploy"

WHAT TO UPLOAD:
==============
Upload ALL files from: E:\WebProjects\dasboard\dist\
Including:
- index.html
- assets/ folder (with all CSS/JS files)
- Any other files in the dist directory

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:
====================
If manual deploy is not available:
1. Create a new site on Netlify
2. Upload the dist folder to the new site
3. Change the domain from the new site to thedasboard.com
4. Delete the old site
